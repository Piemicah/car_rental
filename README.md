# Car Rental Tracking System
## Description
This repository contains python code that tracks car rental services. I created the data using Microsoft excel, which is in csv format. I got the timestamp from https://www.unixtimestamp.com/. The timestamp measures time by the number of seconds that have elapsed since 1st January 1970. I added three more columns: "duration","late return", "car damaged" respectively. I computed the column for duration in hours using formular $duration=\frac{\text{(end timestamp)}-\text{(start timestamp)}}{3600}$
